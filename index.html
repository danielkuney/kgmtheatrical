  <h2>What's up with this website?</h2>
  <p>We used to have a Website (capital intentional). We used Squarespace and there were lots of pages. Lots of text designed to sell us. But this, this feels more authentic. Just one page of HTML. There's no SEO. No CRM. No pixels. No retargeting. (see: No metrics). Here's what you need to know about us and nothing else: we manage a lot of Broadway shows. You need us? Just write. We do the work.</p>
